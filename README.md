## üéØ Problem Definition

### üè¢ Business Context
**AutoMax** is Rwanda's premier automotive dealership network operating across three strategic locations: Kigali, Musanze, and Huye. The company serves both individual consumers and corporate clients, offering a diverse range of vehicles from sedans to commercial pickups.

### üîç Data Challenge
AutoMax management faces critical analytical gaps in their decision-making process:
- **Customer Intelligence:** Inability to identify and rank top-spending customers for targeted marketing
- **Revenue Tracking:** Lack of month-over-month growth analysis and cumulative sales monitoring  
- **Market Segmentation:** No systematic approach to categorize customers into spending quartiles for personalized services

### üéØ Expected Outcome
Implementation of advanced PL/SQL window functions will enable AutoMax to:
- **Prioritize** high-value customers through sophisticated ranking algorithms
- **Monitor** real-time revenue trends with running totals and growth percentages
- **Segment** customer base into actionable quartiles for strategic marketing initiatives
- **Forecast** sales patterns using moving averages for inventory optimization

## ü™ü Window Functions Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ranking Functions - Top Customer Analysis

**Business Question:** *Who are our most valuable customers by total spending?*

```sql
-- Rank customers by total sales amount (highest first)
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    SUM(s.sale_amount) AS total_spent,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s.sale_amount) DESC) AS rank_by_spending
FROM sales s
JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

**Interpretation:** This query identifies AutoMax's top customers by total purchase amount, assigning ranks where ties receive the same rank. Essential for VIP customer identification and loyalty program targeting.

**üì∏ Screenshot:**
![Top Customers by Spending](screenshots/01_ranking_top_customers.png)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregate Functions - Running Sales Totals

**Business Question:** *What is our cumulative sales growth month by month?*

```sql
-- Running sales totals per month
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    SUM(sale_amount) AS monthly_sales,
    SUM(SUM(sale_amount)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')) AS running_total
FROM sales
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month;
```

**Interpretation:** Displays monthly sales alongside cumulative totals, enabling management to track overall business growth trajectory and identify seasonal patterns for strategic planning.

**üì∏ Screenshot:**
![Monthly Running Totals](screenshots/02_aggregate_running_totals.png)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Navigation Functions - Growth Analysis

**Business Question:** *How does each month's performance compare to the previous month?*

```sql
-- Compare monthly sales with previous month
SELECT 
    month,
    monthly_sales,
    LAG(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS prev_month_sales,
    ROUND((monthly_sales - LAG(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month)) 
          / LAG(monthly_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100, 2) AS growth_percent
FROM (
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
        SUM(sale_amount) AS monthly_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
) subquery
ORDER BY month;
```

**Interpretation:** Calculates month-over-month growth percentages using LAG() to access previous month's data. Critical for identifying growth trends, seasonal impacts, and performance acceleration or deceleration.

![Month-over-Month Growth](screenshots/03_navigation_mom_growth.png)

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Distribution Functions - Customer Segmentation

**Business Question:** *How should we segment customers for targeted marketing?*

```sql
-- Divide customers into quartiles based on total spending
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    c.customer_type,
    SUM(s.sale_amount) AS total_spent,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY SUM(s.sale_amount) DESC) AS spending_quartile
FROM sales s
JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.customer_type
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

**Interpretation:** Segments customers into four equal groups (quartiles) where Q1 represents top spenders. Enables targeted marketing strategies: premium services for Q1, retention programs for Q2-Q3, and acquisition campaigns for Q4.

**üì∏ Screenshot:**
![Customer Quartile Segmentation](screenshots/04_distribution_customer_quartiles.png)

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Analytics - Moving Averages

**Business Question:** *What are the smoothed sales trends without monthly fluctuations?*

```sql
-- 3-month moving average for trend analysis
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
    SUM(sale_amount) AS monthly_sales,
    ROUND(AVG(SUM(sale_amount)) OVER (
        ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') 
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ), 2) AS moving_avg_3m
FROM sales
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY month;
```

**Interpretation:** Smooths short-term fluctuations using a 3-month rolling average, revealing underlying sales trends for better forecasting and inventory planning decisions.

## üìä Results Analysis

### üìà Descriptive Analytics - What Happened?

Based on the window function analysis, several key patterns emerge from AutoMax's sales data:

- **Customer Concentration:** Emmanuel Mugisha leads individual customers with total spending of RWF 55,000, followed by corporate client RwandaTech Ltd at RWF 28,000
- **Geographic Distribution:** Kigali branch dominates sales volume, contributing approximately 60% of total revenue
- **Product Preferences:** Toyota vehicles (Corolla, Hilux) show strong market demand with consistent sales across quarters
- **Seasonal Trends:** Monthly sales demonstrate steady growth from January through April 2024, with peak performance in April

### üîç Diagnostic Analytics - Why Did This Happen?

The underlying factors driving these patterns include:

- **Customer Loyalty:** Emmanuel Mugisha's repeat purchases (2 vehicles) indicate successful customer retention strategies
- **Corporate Segments:** Higher average transaction values from corporate clients suggest effective B2B relationship management
- **Location Advantage:** Kigali's superior performance reflects larger market size and better infrastructure access
- **Product-Market Fit:** Toyota's reliability reputation aligns with Rwandan consumer preferences for durability and resale value

### üéØ Prescriptive Analytics - What Should AutoMax Do Next?

Strategic recommendations based on analytical insights:

1. **VIP Customer Program:** Establish exclusive benefits for Q1 quartile customers (Emmanuel Mugisha tier) including priority service, extended warranties, and first access to new inventory

2. **Corporate Expansion:** Leverage RwandaTech success to develop targeted corporate packages for fleet purchases and long-term service contracts

3. **Regional Strategy:** 
   - **Kigali:** Expand inventory and sales staff to capitalize on market leadership
   - **Musanze/Huye:** Implement localized marketing campaigns and consider mobile sales units

4. **Inventory Optimization:** Increase Toyota stock levels based on proven demand patterns while introducing complementary brands for market diversification

5. **Performance Monitoring:** Establish monthly growth alerts when MoM percentage drops below 5% threshold for proactive intervention
